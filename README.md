# password-generator

password generator Challenge week 2

# Purpose

password generator take in user imput to generate a unique and randomized password. the characters need to be a minimum of 8 characters long and a minimum of 128. Capital letters, lower case letters, numbers and symbols are all optional in the password generated and the user is promped each time to select a choice.

# Function

The user can click the generate password button and will be prompted with a series of choices starting with the desired length of the password. Numbers, symbols and capitalisation will be prompted following this choice. each input from the user will trigger true or false statements via 'confirm' pop ups and will push a generator function from an options object into an array. the array will then contain the random characters to choose from and then will be looped through and pushed into a string. that string will be the password and displayed onto the text field on the screen.

edit: that didnt work so I decided to make all the available characters strings and combine them at the end to one string. I then created a loop to generate a password but I was only able to get one character on the display field. needs more work. I found a way to get it to work online through a guide, but I didnt understand it well enough to impliment the code.

# summary

in the end my app dosent run correctly. Im sure Im very very close to a finished product. I will have to tweek it little by little.
